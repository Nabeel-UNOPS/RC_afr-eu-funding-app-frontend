## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1A438A) to convey trust and stability, reflecting the established nature of UNOPS and the EU. It evokes the 'European' aspect without directly copying the EU flag.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F2F5), providing a clean and professional backdrop for content.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#E67E22) to highlight calls to action, deadlines, and other important information, drawing user attention effectively.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, creates a balance of modernism and readability.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent funding types, regions, and other categories. Icons should be easily recognizable and consistent throughout the application.
- Design a modular and scalable layout to accommodate additional regions and donors in the future without requiring significant redesign.
- Implement subtle animations for transitions and feedback to improve user experience without being distracting. Example: A loading animation for search results.
